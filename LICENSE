FFmpeg.Autogen
=================================================================================================

All FFmpeg bindings were generated using a tool called FFmpeg.Autogen
The tool was obtained from https://github.com/Ruslan-B/FFmpeg.AutoGen
While the tool itself is distributed under the LGPLv3, the output of the tool does not specify
a license. I leave it up to someone else to figure it out. In any case, here is a copy of the
license @RuslanB has posted on his GitHub repository:

The FFmpeg image/logo/icon was created by Barry Mieny and obtained from his DeviantArt site:
http://barrymieny.deviantart.com/art/isabi3-for-Windows-105473015
The only modifications added were some sropping, size optimization and a background grid for the
control's preview.
